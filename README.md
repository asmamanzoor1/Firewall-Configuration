# 🛡️ Basic Firewall Configuration Project

### Overview  
This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly firewall setup using **Debian Linux** running inside a **UTM virtual machine** on my Mac. The goal was to configure the firewall, secure open ports, and practice basic network security commands.

---

### 🖥️ Environment  
- Host: macOS (MacBook Air M3)  
- Virtual Machine: Debian ARM 64 (via UTM)  
- Firewall Tool: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)  

---

### 🔧 What I Did  

1. **Installed Debian in UTM** and set up the virtual machine.  
2. Configured network settings to allow communication between host and VM.  
3. Installed and enabled `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) to manage firewall rules.  
4. Allowed specific ports (e.g., SSH port 22, HTTP port 80).  
5. Denied all other incoming connections by default.  
6. Tested firewall rules by attempting network connections between my Mac and the Debian VM.
